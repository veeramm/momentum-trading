Below are insights into ideal weights for stock action determination and how to handle missing data.

## Current Weight Implementation

In `enhanced_advanced_momentum.py` file, the current weights are:
- **Technical Analysis**: 50%
- **Fundamental Analysis**: 30%
- **Sentiment Analysis**: 20%

## Ideal Weights Considerations

The "ideal" weights depend on trading strategy and time frame:

### 1. For Intermediate-Term Momentum Trading (weeks to months):
```python
# Recommended weights
technical_weight = 0.50
fundamental_weight = 0.30
sentiment_weight = 0.20
```
This balance makes sense because:
- Technical indicators are crucial for momentum timing
- Fundamentals provide underlying value support
- Sentiment captures market psychology

### 2. For Long-Term Momentum Trading (months to years):
```python
# Long-term focused weights
technical_weight = 0.40
fundamental_weight = 0.40
sentiment_weight = 0.20
```
This shift acknowledges that fundamentals become more important over longer periods.

### 3. For Short-Term Trading (days to weeks):
```python
# Short-term focused weights
technical_weight = 0.60
fundamental_weight = 0.10
sentiment_weight = 0.30
```
Short-term moves are driven more by technical patterns and sentiment.

## Impact on Actions (BUY/SELL/HOLD)

Missing data can skew actions in the following ways:

### 1. Missing Fundamental Data
- **Impact**: May lead to overreliance on technical patterns
- **Risk**: Buying technically strong but fundamentally weak stocks
- **Mitigation**: Use neutral fundamental score (0.5) instead of 0

### 2. Missing Sentiment Data
- **Impact**: Loses market psychology component
- **Risk**: Missing potential trend reversals or accelerations
- **Mitigation**: Use technical volume indicators as sentiment proxy

### 3. Multiple Missing Data Types
- **Impact**: Significantly reduces confidence in signals
- **Risk**: False positives/negatives increase
- **Mitigation**: Require higher thresholds for action
